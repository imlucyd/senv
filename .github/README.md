# Senv

## Why?

It's annoying to have to manually update each **environment variable** or rename **.env** files in order to change to specific configurations for a project.
The problem is multiplied if you are working on more than a single project at the same time so the idea here is to have a **senv.yaml** in each one of your
projects when you think that you're dealing with multiple **.env** settings.

You can call the program in any subdirectory of your project and the program will automatically find the **senv.yaml**.

It's highly inspired by [VSCode - .ENV Switcher](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=EcksDy.env-switcher) but only deals with a single
configuration file and can be called directly from the command line.

## Install

```bash
# Requires go >=1.18
$ go install github.com/luisnquin/senv@latest
```

## Try it with Nix ❄️

```bash
# Creates a senv.yaml file in your current folder
$ nix run github:luisnquin/senv -- init

# Lists your declared environments
$ nix run github:luisnquin/senv -- ls

# Run a prompt that allows you to select an environment
$ nix run github:luisnquin/senv

# Help
$ nix run github:luisnquin/senv -- --help

# ...
```

## Settings file

The program requires a **senv.yaml** or **senv.yml** file. You can call the program in any subdirectory
of the project but for that it requires that the **settings file** is at the same level of your **.git folder**.

### Example

Suppose we have a **senv.yaml** file like this:

```yaml
# senv.yaml
envFile: ./app/.env # optional absolute/relative path
envs:
- name: dev
  variables:
    DATABASE_USER: admin
    DATABASE_PASSWORD: pwd123
    DATABASE_HOST: localhost
- name: dev-2
  variables:
    DATABASE_USER: admin
    DATABASE_PASSWORD: pwd321
    DATABASE_HOST: test-host
- name: prod
  variables:
    DATABASE_USER: admin
    DATABASE_PASSWORD: test-password
    DATABASE_HOST: test-host
- name: preprod
  variables:
    DATABASE_PASSWORD: root123
    DATABASE_HOST: localhost
defaults:
  DATABASE_USER: admin # both variables will be added to the
  DATABASE_PORT: 5432 # selected environment if not declared
useExportPrefix: false # optional
```

When the .env file is generated from **preprod** it will look like this:

```bash
#_preprod_#

DATABASE_PASSWORD="root123"
DATABASE_HOST="localhost"
DATABASE_USER="admin"
DATABASE_PORT="5432"
```
